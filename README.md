# custom_scripts
 A Bash automation script to perform comprehensive subdomain enumeration, live host detection and vulnerability scanning on a given domain. It chains together powerful open source tools like Subfinder, Assetfinder, Findomain, Sublist3r, httpx, nuclei and notify to streamline reconnaissance during web application security assessments. The script identifies subdomains from multiple sources filters for active hosts and scans them for security issues using Nuclei templates. It can detect known vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution (RCE), SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), authentication bypasses and outdated or vulnerable third-party software via CVE-based scanning. It also checks for open redirects and common misconfigurations such as exposed admin panels, unsecured development environments, directory listings, CORS issues, improper HTTP headers, and weak/default credentials. Real-time alerts are sent via notify allowing immediate visibility into potential issues through platforms like Discord.
